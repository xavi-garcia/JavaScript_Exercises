//JAVASCRIPT IS A DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE

//The type of a variable is checked during run-time in contrast to a statically typed language, where the type of a variable is checked during compile-time.
//variables in JS are not associated with any type. A variable can hold the value of any data type.
//For example, a variable that is assigned a number type can be converted to a string type:

var a = 23;
var a = "Hello World!";
